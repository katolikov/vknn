# VKNN vs MNN — on-device benchmarks

Head-to-head against [MNN](https://github.com/alibaba/MNN) (Alibaba's production inference
engine) on the **same device, same model, both at their fastest config**. Every VKNN number comes from a
pipeline verified against an onnxruntime golden — fast *and* correct, not fast-but-wrong.

## Setup

- **Device:** an Android arm64-v8a device with an AMD RDNA-class mobile GPU, Vulkan 1.3+.
- **Precision:** fp16 on both (VKNN `--precision fp16`, MNN `precision=Low`), warm caches/tuning.
- **VKNN runner:** `vknn_classify --backend vulkan --precision fp16 --bench 20` (timed `run()` calls,
  including the host↔device pack/unpack).
- **MNN runner:** `MNNV2Basic.out model 20 0 <fwd> <mode> 2 1x3xHxW`. MNN has three backends here —
  Vulkan (`fwd=7`), CPU-4-thread (`fwd=0`), and OpenCL with HEAVY tuning (`fwd=3 mode=2`) — and they
  differ a lot, so "MNN-best" is the min over all three.
- **Thermal control is mandatory.** The device throttles 3–5× under sustained load, and VKNN (GPU-compute-bound)
  throttles more than MNN-Vulkan (overhead-bound). All numbers below use a 12–14 s cooldown
  **before each run**; absolute numbers and ratios from back-to-back sweeps are not trustworthy.

## VKNN vs MNN-Vulkan (fp16)

VKNN beats MNN's Vulkan backend on every model, by a wide margin on the small/depthwise nets:

| Model (Vulkan fp16) | VKNN median | MNN-Vulkan | speedup | VKNN vs ORT |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| MobileNetV2 | 2.8 ms | 13.8 ms | ~4.9× | cosine 0.99997 |
| MobileNetV3-Large | 2.5 ms | 17.0 ms | ~6.8× | cosine 0.99954 |
| SqueezeNet 1.1 | 2.4 ms | 10.9 ms | ~4.5× | cosine 0.99998 |
| EfficientNet-B0 | 4.2 ms | 19.9 ms | ~4.7× | cosine 0.99983 |
| ResNet-50 | 14.7 ms | 18.3 ms | ~1.25× | cosine 1.000000 |
| Inception-v3 | 18.3 ms | 25.6 ms | ~1.4× | cosine 0.99998 |
| YOLOv8n (640×640) | 17.5 ms | ~73 ms | ~4.2× | cosine 1.000000 |

YOLOv8n runs **100% on the GPU** (1 segment, no CPU fallback) — the flat row-major op path moved the
whole DFL / box-decode head onto the GPU.

## End-to-end, per stage

A real inference is more than the GPU run: you open the model, build the session, copy the input over,
run, and copy the result back. Each stage below is on the same device, both Vulkan fp16, warm (caches
and tuning already built):

| Stage | VKNN ResNet-50 | MNN ResNet-50 | VKNN MobileNetV3 | MNN MobileNetV3 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| open model | 37 ms | —¹ | 6 ms | —¹ |
| create session | 268 ms | 960 ms | 211 ms | 904 ms |
| copy in (host→device) | 0.10 ms | —² | 0.10 ms | —² |
| run (inference) | 10.5 ms | 24.2 ms | 1.95 ms | 19.5 ms |
| copy out (device→host) | 0.03 ms | —² | 0.01 ms | —² |
| **end-to-end (load + 1 run)** | **~316 ms** | **~985 ms** | **~219 ms** | **~924 ms** |

¹ `MNNV2Basic` prints "Open Model" with no time; MNN's `createFromFile` is a few milliseconds.
² `MNNV2Basic` does not time the host↔device copies (the input is set once, outside the timed loop).
VKNN's are sub-millisecond because the device is UMA — there is no staging copy.

VKNN reaches a first result in roughly **3× less wall time**, almost entirely because MNN-Vulkan spends
~0.9 s compiling its pipelines at session creation, while VKNN builds the session in ~0.2–0.3 s from
its cached pipelines/weights and one pre-recorded command buffer. Steady-state inference is 2–10×
faster too, and the pack/unpack at the I/O boundary costs almost nothing.

Methodology: VKNN stages come from a small timer using the public API (`loadGraphBin` = open model,
`Runtime::load` = open + create session, `VKNN_TIMING` = pack / submit+gpu / unpack). MNN stages come
from `MNNV2Basic.out` (the `Resize` cost = create session, `Run Avg` = inference). Both warm, 12+ runs,
GPU cooled between measurements.

## VKNN vs MNN's absolute best (OpenCL, HEAVY-tuned)

MNN's true best on conv-heavy nets is its **OpenCL** backend with HEAVY autotuning, which does run on
this device. Against it the picture is mixed — VKNN wins the depthwise / SE / parallel-branch nets, and
MNN wins the 3×3-conv-heavy ones:

- **VKNN wins:** MobileNetV2 (+15%), MobileNetV3 (+14%), MnasNet (+9%), Inception-v3 (+8%),
  EfficientNet-B0 (~1.9×).
- **MNN-OpenCL-tuned wins:** ResNet-50 (10.2 vs 14.7 ms, +43%), YOLOv8n (+50%), SqueezeNet (+10%),
  DenseNet-121 (+14%).

The remaining gap is conv-kernel quality: MNN's years-tuned Winograd / cooperative-matrix-style 3×3
and 1×1 kernels beat VKNN's direct kernels on the conv-bound models. On this driver
only **split-K for deep 1×1** and **precise data-dependency barriers** beat the direct kernels.
Register-tiled 3×3, LDS input-halo, and Winograd (3-pass and fused) were all implemented, verified
correct, and **regressed** — the driver punishes register/LDS/occupancy pressure, and the 3×3 weights
already L2-cache, so cutting weight reads doesn't cut DRAM traffic. Matching MNN there needs a
production fused-cooperative Winograd, a substantial kernel.

## YoNoSplat encoder (965M-param transformer)

The feed-forward 3D-Gaussian-Splatting encoder (DINOv2 ViT-L/14 backbone + RoPE decoders + Gaussian /
camera heads) runs **end-to-end on the GPU**, 1 segment over ~8700 nodes:

| Model | VKNN (Vulkan fp16) | MNN |
|---|---|---|
| YoNoSplat encoder (2 views → 100352 Gaussians) | ~13.5 s | cannot convert |

MNN's converter fails on the encoder's dynamic-shape geometry tail (`Reshape error 301056 → 6`,
"Model larger than 2GB"), so VKNN is the only engine that runs this model correctly on-device. The
GPU time is dominated by the 509 batched matmuls (~1538 GFLOP, ALU/latency-bound at ~142 GFLOP/s on
this driver); the rasterizer that consumes the 6 Gaussian outputs is a separate Vulkan compute pass
(see [../skills/run-yonosplat.md](../skills/run-yonosplat.md)).

## Measurement notes

- Use `VKNN_TIMING=1` for the real submit+GPU time (pack / submit+gpu / unpack). The per-op profiler
  sum is inflated by forced per-op barriers — relative only.
- `rm -rf` the model's cache dir before timing a fresh build.
- VKNN's latency is very consistent (the whole static graph is one pre-recorded command buffer);
  MNN-Vulkan has higher cold-loop variance.
